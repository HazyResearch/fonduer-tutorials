    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through the process of using `Fonduer` to extract relations from [**richly formatted** data](https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/fonduer.html), where information is conveyed via combinations of textual, structural and tabular, and visual expressions, as seen in webpages, business reports, product specifications, and scientific literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use `Fonduer` to identify the place of birth of presidents and vice presidents from their wikipedia articles. The HTML files are generated from Wikipedia's markup language Wikitext via [wtf_wikipedia](https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is broken into several parts, each covering a phase of the `Fonduer` pipeline (as outlined in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05028)), and the iterative KBC process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. KBC Initialization\n",
    "2. Candidate Generation and Multimodal Featurization\n",
    "3. Probabilistic Relation Classification\n",
    "4. Error Analysis and Iterative KBC\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we show how users can iteratively improve labeling functions to improve relation extraction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Phase 1: KBC Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first phase of `Fonduer`'s pipeline, `Fonduer` uses a user-specified _schema_ to initialize a relational database where the output KB will be stored. Furthermore, `Fonduer` iterates over its input _corpus_ and transforms each document into a unified data model, which captures the variability and multimodality of richly formatted data. This unified data model then servers as an intermediate representation used in the rest of the phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessed data is saved to a database. The connection string to the database is provided to the `Meta` object, which will initialize a PostgreSQL database for parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize several variables for convenience that define what the database should be called and what level of parallelization the `Fonduer` pipeline will be run with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you continue, please make sure that you have PostgreSQL installed and have created a new database named `pob_presidents`."
