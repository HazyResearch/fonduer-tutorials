# Getting Started with Fonduer

To help you get started, these tutorials provide an overview of the three main
components of Fonduer. By reviewing these tutorials, you will learn how
Fonduer's data model is populated and structured, how candidates are generated,
and what APIs are available for you to provide weak supervision.

## Interactive Introductory Tutorials

1.  **[Fonduer's Data Model](Intro_Data_Model.ipynb)**: Learn how data is
    processed into Fonduer's multimodal data model, which serves as the unified
    representation for the rest of the pipeline.
2.  **[Generating Candidates with Matchers and
    Throttlers](Intro_Candidates.ipynb)**: Explore how candidates are generated
    in Fonduer by using _matchers_ to define your relation types and
    _throttlers_ as filtering functions.
3.  **[Weak Supervision for Richly Formatted Data](Intro_Supervision.ipynb)**:
    Fonduer leverages _weak supervision_ to create large amounts of richly
    formatted training data. Learn the ways you can provide supervision signals
    in this Tutorial.

## Advanced Tutorials

In the future, we will add additional tutorials for more advanced Fonduer
features such as adding new document preprocessors and extending the data
model.
